</h1> LIBRARY PROJECT IN DJANGO WITH STRIPE </h1>

<p> That's a project created by me, i was created him in past and updated on few time
I use Stripe api to create the payment process
When the user go to the page him can choose if want be a writer or just a user
If the user is a writer he can post his books in site and put a price
If the user is just a user he can see his books in site and can buy them
Later user buy a book or many books he go recive a email from the site and see if his payment was sucessfully received, together with the price of purchase </p>
